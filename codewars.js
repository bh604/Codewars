// In this kata you will create a function that takes in a list and returns a list with the reverse order.

// Examples (Input -> Output)
// * [1, 2, 3, 4]  -> [4, 3, 2, 1]
// * [9, 2, 0, 7]  -> [7, 0, 2, 9]

// const reverseList = list => list.reverse()




// Write a function get_char() / getChar() which takes a number and returns the corresponding ASCII char for that value.

// Example:

// get_char(65)
// should return:

// 'A'

// function getChar(number) {
//     return String.fromChatCode(number)
// }



// The wide-mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of other creatures.

// He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to eat. But, then he meets the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!

// When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.

// Your goal in this kata is to create complete the mouth_size method this method takes one argument animal which corresponds to the animal encountered by the frog. If this one is an alligator (case-insensitive) return small otherwise return wide.

// const mouthSize = animal => animal.toLowerCase() == 'alligator' ? 'small' : 'wide'
